This will need to be opened using unreal 5.2 or newer specifically first as there is an issue with a custom plug-in not wanting to compile from vs,after that it compiles fine. 

A template that is going to be used as a base for all the 2D games that gets made later in Unreal for myself.

It has a system setup to clamp the camera to the map for when the player is at the edge of the map. 

it has a paralaxing background system that is setup using materials and the player themselves

components and data assets to handle the animations of the player alone, this will need tweaked later depending on the animations that is going to be getting used in the player animations system
This can be used for other aspects, I.E Enemies and projectiles if wanted, but it will need the respective sub-components to be made for them
